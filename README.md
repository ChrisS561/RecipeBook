# Description 
Welcome to my Recipe Search Web Application, a powerful tool crafted with React.js and Firebase authentication, showcasing my skills in developing interactive and practical web applications. It enables users to effortlessly discover recipes based on the ingredients they have at home, while also providing local weather information for added convenience.

In today's fast-paced world, where time is often limited, this application empowers users to embark on culinary adventures without the hassle of planning. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a kitchen novice, this project simplifies the cooking process:
# Key Features:

*`Ingredient-Based Recipe Search`*: Users can input the ingredients available in their kitchen, and the application intelligently fetches and displays a list of recipes that can be prepared using those ingredients.

*`Authentication with Firebase`*: We've implemented Firebase for user authentication, ensuring secure access and personalized experiences.

*`API Integration`*: The project leverages the Spoonacular Recipe – Food – Nutrition API to dynamically fetch and present a wide range of recipes. Additionally, we've integrated a weather API to provide users with real-time local weather information.

# Technologies Used:

*`React.js`*: The frontend of the application is built using React.js, providing a smooth and responsive user interface.

*`Firebase`*: Firebase handles authentication, ensuring user data security.

*`Spoonacular Recipe API`*: This powerful API is used to fetch and display recipes based on user input.

# Installation
 ``` Available Scripts ```
In the project directory, you can run:

```npm start```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

``` npm test```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

```npm run build```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

``` npm run eject```
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
